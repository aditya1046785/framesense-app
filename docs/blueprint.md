# **App Name**: FrameSense

## Core Features:

- Frame Fit Analysis: Analyze photos of frames (front and side) to determine fit, providing a verdict (too wide/just right/too tight) and estimated size. Utilizes a tool for frame keypoint detection and measurement estimation in the cloud.
- Current Glasses Analysis: Analyze selfies of the user wearing their current glasses to assess fit, estimate size, and classify shape.
- Image Quality Check: Provide live feedback on image quality during capture, blocking poor-quality images and warning on minor issues.
- Reference Object Selection: Allow users to select a reference object (card, coin, or A4 paper) to improve accuracy.  Offers a face-only estimate as a fallback.
- Results Visualization: Display results with a clear verdict, visual overlays on the selfie, size estimates, style/shape classification, and red-flag triage (if applicable).
- Report Generation and Sharing: Generate a report with analysis results (including images, measurements, and recommendations), which can be sent via email or SMS, and provide a shareable link to results.
- Language Support: Support for English and Hindi languages, with a language picker on first launch and in the header/menu.
